                As several other lagoon settlements of the Venetian archipelago, the island of San Secondo was more than a spiritual space solely devoted to a contemplative life.
                It embodied a key site of a complex network committed to support the Dominican community itself
    
                <!--[SOU_42]-->,
    
                but not less involved in preserving Venice’s urban framework.
                Its position along one of the vital approach routes to the capital city from the mainland enabled it to take on crucial functions closely linked to the daily food and water supply of the lagoon.
                This provision role was reflected in the presence of a series of buildings for food production.
                Within the boundaries of the tiny island were situated spaces for storing and working sustainable resources, as well as infrastructure that served the monastic populace. Facilities, arranged mainly in the eastern part of the complex, included a

                Venetian nunneries and monasteries were, in fact, an integral part of Venetian social and cultural life,
                as well as the urban and economic essence of the everyday city.
                San Secondo held a special place in notions of both monastic hospitality and economy.

The island was covered by orderly vegetable gardens, charming orchards, and delicate gardens including a small laurel woods that “seems to be dedicated to the Muses», as prior Domenico Codagli [PEO_41] described in his Historia dell’isola e monasterio di San Secondo di Venetia (1609) [SOU_168].

                among the vegetables pumpkins, eggplants, watermelons, and melons standed out. Moreover, there were medicinal and aromatic herbs including mint, rosemary, and mandrake. Finally, tulips, hyacinths, roses, jasmine, and carnations were joy for the eyes.

                Codagli’s text is a passionate description, sometimes of praise. His engrossment in detail conveys the prior’s intimate bond to the site, in addition to his clear understanding of the significance of the island’s green areas in the everyday life activities of the city. Nevertheless, the abundance and luxuriance of these spaces are confirmed by a 1626 list of all friars’ plants and herbs, which is preserved in the private archive of the religious community [SOU_170].

                Fruits, vegetables, and horticultural plants were instrumental in securing San Secondo’s food independence of its community, while also contributing to the city’s general supply. Sixteenth-century tenant farmers’ contracts confirm the extensive use of the island’s vegetable garden for cultivations destined to be sold outside its precincts, thereby rejecting the idea of religious life as a spiritual and secluded world.

                But the island was not used only by travellers. Lists of mansionarie (commemorative masses) regularly held in the church of San Secondo also included some “vacation ceremonies.” This evidence would confirm what the cosmographer Father Vincenzo Maria Coronelli [PEO_46] recalled about the guest house serving as an agreeable shelter for noble and wealthy citizens looking for somewhere cool during the hottest days. In addition, archival sources reveal that over the centuries the island became the chief destination of noble Venetians even for long stays. Within San Secondo’s walls may have found refuge — but the question is still debated — Daria Querini [PEO_201], the widow of Alvise Contarini, who likely retired to the monastery after her husband’s death. She is portrayed in a precious miniature [SOU_30] by Jacometto Veneziano [PEO_36], today preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York, in whose background the small island of San Secondo stands out prominently.
